# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The work day scheduler is a scheduler built for whatever purpose you desire. It simply uses a javascript library called moment.js, to keep track of your time and day. You can select between 9am and 5pm to write for your work schedule. The lock button next to the text saves your text. And the good thing about this is that it saves in a local storage so your data will not be lost upon reloading the webpage.
